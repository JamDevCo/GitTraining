##### Lesson Learnt
- Learnt how others use `git` and their mindset towards it.
- There are a lot of unused `git` commands.
- I personally haven't use `git cherry-pick` as much as I thought.
- As an host, I should take it slow and not overwhelm the audience.
- Not a lot of developers use `git rebase`, `git reflog`, `git cherry-pick` and `git stash`.
- There's an interest in working on open source projects.

##### What I wish to learn next?
- Github labels
- Github Actions
- Using Docker with Github Actions
- Automated testing with Github
