> project, a **git url** or **https url**.

##### Cloning with HTTPS URL
If you don't have a `SSH key` setup on Github, then I recommend that you use the HTTPs version for this tutorial

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamaicanDevelopers/GitTraining.git
```

##### Cloning with HTTPS URL
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JamaicanDevelopers/GitTraining.git
cd GitTraining
